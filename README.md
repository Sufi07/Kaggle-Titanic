# Kaggle Titanic Project

## Objective:
In this Project, the goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

##Challenge-Kaggle:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Models: XGBoost

Here we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the official documentation.
